"""
Worked end-to-end example — load → look → predict → score.

This is the whole loop in ~15 lines of real work. It drops you exactly where the interesting
part starts: you have the image under a plot, a naive prediction, and a score. Everything after
this — a better correction, a confidence that means something — is yours.

Run (after downloading a bundle into data/<village>/):
    uv run quickstart.py data/34855_vadnerbhairav_chandavad_nashik
